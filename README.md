# H2O FHIR-Based Conceptual Model

The conceptual model of H2O will be published here. To foster maintainability a divide-and-conquer approach is followed. Thus, for the moment, instead of providing a complete model several models are provided (more on the row). The models are stored in [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) files. When needed, a model should reference one or more available models. The complete list of the models is as follows:
- [Observation Model]{https://github.com/IMI-H2O/h2o-conceptual-model#observation-model};
- [Questionnaire Model]{https://github.com/IMI-H2O/h2o-conceptual-model#questionnaire-model}; and
- [(Generic) ValueSet Model]{https://github.com/IMI-H2O/h2o-conceptual-model/blob/main/README.md#generic-valueset-model}.
